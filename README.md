# Exilios

## What is Exilios?
	Exilios is a streamers companion application. Designed to help the streamer and provide interaction to the audience. When alpha is released, you will be able to read and post to chat from both YouTube Live and Twitch. Along with that it will have Twitter intergration allowing the user to notify his/her audience of an upcoming stream!
	
## Roadmap
	This will be filled in very soon. I'm still trying to be able to balance this school and my mobile game project.
